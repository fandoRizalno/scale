- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

## How To Run The Project.

- Install Flutter and Dart:

Make sure Flutter is installed on your computer. You can download and follow the installation instructions from the official Flutter website.
Dart SDK comes with Flutter, so you don’t need to install it separately.

- Install VSCode:

If you haven’t already, download and install Visual Studio Code.

- Install Flutter and Dart Extensions in VSCode:

Open VSCode and go to the Extensions view (Ctrl+Shift+X).
Search for "Flutter" and "Dart" and install both extensions.

- Configure Flutter:

Open the terminal in VSCode (Ctrl+` or via the Terminal menu > New Terminal).
Run flutter doctor to check if there are any issues that need fixing or updating.

- Open Your Flutter Project:

Open your Flutter project folder in VSCode by selecting File > Open Folder and choosing your project folder.

- Run Your Application:

Make sure an emulator or physical device is connected and detected.
Select your target device from the status bar at the bottom of VSCode (if you have more than one device).
Press F5 or select Run > Start Debugging to run your application.

- Use Command Palette:

You can also open the Command Palette with Ctrl+Shift+P and type "Flutter: Select Device" to choose a device or "Flutter: Run" to start the application.
